# Content-Based Song Recommendation System

This project is a content-based song recommendation system implemented using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. The system recommends songs to users based on the similarity of their features such as genre, artist, energy, loudness, valence, popularity, etc.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in JSON format and contains information about songs. Each song entry includes the following features:

    'Title' is categorical.
    'Artist' is categorical.
    'Genre of the track' is categorical.
    'Year' is quantitative.
    'BeatsPerMinute' is quantitative.
    'Energy' is quantitative.
    'Danceability' is quantitative.
    'Loudness/dB' is quantitative.
    'Liveness' is quantitative.
    'Valence' is quantitative.
    'Acousticness' is quantitative.
    'Speechiness' is quantitative.
    'Popularity' is quantitative.

# Results
The final outcome of the system is a stack or playlist that
contains all the newly suggested songs determined by the K-
Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
ideally, the system will make whole playlists for the user based on his
listening history, and potentially introduce new tracks from
genres that the user may not typically explore.

Additional documentation and explanations about the project can be found in the 'docs' directory. It includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, the dataset format, and other relevant information.

# Collaborators
Collaboratively developed by Mohamed Amine SALIMI (M0-Amine) and Khaoula JELLAL, this project serves as an assignment for the 'Algorithmique II' course in the first year at UM6P-CS School Of Computer Science.
